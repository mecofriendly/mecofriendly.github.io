    <h1>about us</h1>
    <div class="textabout2">
    <p>Our number one goal is to make incomparably beautiful jewelry,</p>
    <p>just for you. At our San Francisco design studio, </p>
    <p>our team designs every piece to delight you, </p>
    <p>from the first time you see it and every day after. </p>
    <p>We carefully consider the entire piece—the artfully tapered prongs; </p>
    <p>the hidden accents under the center gem; the precisely curved interior of each band.</p>
    <p>We obsess over comfort, quality, and durability to ensure </p>
    <p>that this is jewelry you will cherish for a lifetime.</p>

<div class="textabout3">
    <p>Caring about the planet and its people is part of who we are.</p>
    <p>That is why we contribute to programs that are dedicated to improving </p>
    <p>social and environmental practices, including Feeding America, </p>
    <p>the Rainforest Alliance, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.</p>
    <p>We support initiatives for education & vocational training; </p>
    <p>fair mining practices; protecting children from child labor; </p>
    <p>and restoring land that has been destroyed by unregulated mining.</p>
